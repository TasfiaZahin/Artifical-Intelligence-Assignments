**Prince's Tour** - A prince can be considered a special chess piece that can move one square to the east, south and north-west. Given a chess board of size n by n and a starting coordinate, this assignment determines if it is possible for the prince to take a tour covering all squares of the board and the corresponding pathway.

**15-puzzle** - An enhancement of the 8-puzzle game. There are 15 puzzle pieces randomly shuffled on a 4 by 4 sized grid with one empty slot. This assignment uses heuristic based information to move the pieces to their target positions.

**Grid Path Finding Problem** - User specifies a n by n sized board, a source coordinate, a destination coordinate and a percentage of squares that are randomly blocked. This assignment uses A* Search to determine an existing path from source to destination. 

**Travelling Salesman Problem** - Given coordinates of n cities, the assignment uses heuristic based guidance to find the shortest tour that visits all cities and returns to the origin city.
